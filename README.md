## Hello there! ‚òÅ

üëã Hi there! I'm a career switcher who transitioned from business consulting to tech and it's been an exciting ride! My journey began with self-learning to code and later completed a cloud administrator bootcamp, which opened the door to my first tech role as a Junior Infrastructure Engineer at The Royal Opera House. With +3 years of hands on cloud experience, I‚Äôve supported AWS and Azure environments, written automation scripts for cloud deployments, and focused on building secure, reliable, and cost-effective infrastructure.

I possess a comprehensive understanding of the business landscape, allowing me to collaborate closely with senior level, globally situated peers across various lines of business, and effectively convey technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders, bridging the gap between business and technology, to deliver solutions that not only meet technical requirements but also align with overarching business objectives, providing innovative and effective solutions that enable clients to achieve their business outcomes. 

I‚Äôm especially interested in cloud automation, infrastructure as code, and finding smart ways to make systems more efficient and scalable. I'm passionate about learning, growing, and contributing to projects that make a real impact. It‚Äôs been a great journey so far and I‚Äôm just getting started üöÄ‚òÅÔ∏è.
